This is the way of the future. A method to create web pages minus all the gunk that conventional
CMS offers. The single static web page view. Dynamic and fast:

I plan on going through the STD library writing short programs with the most used 
methods .

My original plan was to create a ~Desktop/programmming/cpp/c++11/ directory 
and start with folders describing what we plan on learning. 

We will start describing the template class due to the fact that it's such
a fundamental core component with multiple uses.

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <class T>
void output (const T & n)
{
  cout << n << endl;
}

int main() {
   output(10);
   output(3.14);
   output("hello world");
   return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}



Notice the multiple ways you can output using the template class.
